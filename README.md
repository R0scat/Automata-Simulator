# Automata Simulator

Python script that simulates a working DFA, reads a string of commands, displays the states the automata passes through and checks if the final state is accepted or not.

## Setup
In the *in.txt* file:
- include your automata states, alphabet, transitions, start state and final states in this order
- include *#end* after each field
- write transitions with the following format: 
    
        [start state], [alphabet letter], [final state] 

*Note:*You can add comments anywhere using "#"; if you want to add multiple states/ words on one line you must seperate them with a ",".
